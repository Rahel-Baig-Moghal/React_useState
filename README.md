Here's a sample `README.md` file for your React application:

```

This will start the application and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of a simple React component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the counter state.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function increase() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  function decrease() {
    setCount(count - 1);
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increase}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrease}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- `useState(0)`: Initializes the `count` state variable to `0`.
- `increase`: Increments the `count` by 1.
- `decrease`: Decrements the `count` by 1.
- The `App` component renders the current `count` and two buttons to increase and decrease the counter.
